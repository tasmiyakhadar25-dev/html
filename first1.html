    <h6>about kannada</h6>
    <p>Kannada is one of the major Dravidian languages of India, serving as the official and administrative language of
        the state of Karnataka. Spoken by over 50 million people worldwide, it is a rich, ancient language with a
        written history extending back roughly 1,500 years, with the earliest known inscription, the Halmidi
        inscription, dating back to about 450 CE. In 2008, the Government of India recognized Kannada as a "classical
        language" due to its antiquity and independent literary tradition. It is characterized by three main historical
        phases: Old Kannada (Halegannada), Middle Kannada (Nadugannada), and Modern Kannada (Hosagannada). <br> <br>
        The language boasts a, profound literary tradition, with 8 Jnanpith Award winners in the last forty years,
        reflecting a rich culture of poetry and prose. Kannada literature is traditionally categorized by the influence
        of Jainism, Lingayatism, and Vaishnava movements, with notable contributions like the Kavirajamarga. Modern
        Kannada is written in the Kannada script, derived from the Brahmi script, which is phonetic and contains 49
        letters. Today, Kannada serves as a key symbol of Karnataka's culture, heritage, and identity, playing an
        essential role in the state's educational, business, and IT sectors.
